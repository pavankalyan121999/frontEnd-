		Anger is growing in Turkey over the government's perceived failure to prepare after thousands died in two huge earthquakes on Monday.
	</p>

	<p>
		The death toll in Turkey is now above <strong>8,500</strong> and is expected to rise further in the days ahead.</p>
	<p>

		President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the figures as he arrived in one of the worst-affected regions.</p>
	<p>

		But there is growing anger politically and on the ground at his government's response and preparation.</p>
